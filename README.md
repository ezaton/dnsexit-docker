# dnsexit-docker

Derived from a docker script created by nowsci, which can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/nowsci/dnsexit

You need to use an API Key, which can be obtained using this documentation: https://dnsexit.com/dns/dns-api/

A docker-compose.yaml file can be seen in the example. Insert your own values in the variables "HOST" and "APIKEY"
